(j)  	Given three points (x1, y1), (x2, y2) and (x3, y3), write a
	program to check if all the three points fall on one straight line.

(k) 	Given the coordinates (x, y) of a center of a circle and itâ€™s radius,
	write a program which will determine whether a point lies inside
	the circle, on the circle or outside the circle.
	(Hint: Use sqrt( ) and pow( ) functions)

(l) 	Given a point (x, y), write a program to find out if it lies on the
